# KuramotoOscillatorTravelingSalesman
The computational codes for the Travelling Salesman Problem via exclusive interactions of Kuraimoto oscillators, along with its computational results (Excel files and videos), are included. The calculations should be performed by executing the following three files:

Fig1_2_3_EDFig1_ODE_calculation_NbodyTravellingSalesman_VariousParameters.m
Fig4_EDFig2_ODE_calculation_NbodyTravellingSalesman_OscillatorDoping.m
Fig5_ODE_calculation_50bodyTravellingSalesman.m.

Other files, such as dope_an_oscillator.m, whose names begin with lowercase letters, are subroutines called by the above programmes.

The names of the MATLAB code files, Excel files, and video files correspond to the figures.
